# Text Analyser
The "text_analysis" project is a Python-based solution tailored to facilitate complex text analysis. Leveraging the power of Python, at the moment, the project encapsulates a range of methods into a single class, thereby offering an integrated solution for text analysis needs.

### Features
Text Cleaning: Methods to clean and preprocess text data, including removing unwanted characters, such as punctuation and newline characters, and converting text to lowercase to facilitate further analysis.

Word Frequency Analysis: Functionality to analyze the frequency of individual words in a given text, helping users to identify the most prominent words and themes in a string.

### Future Features
Sentiment Analysis (Future Release): We aim to integrate sentiment analysis capabilities, empowering users to gauge the sentiment or tone of a text through natural language processing techniques.
 
#### Usage
To get started with the "text_analysis" project, simply import the TextAnalysis class into your Python script and create an instance with your text data as the argument. From there, you can call various methods to analyze your text in different ways.

#### Contribution
We welcome contributions from the open-source community. Whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or suggesting new features, we appreciate your help in making "text_analysis" better.
